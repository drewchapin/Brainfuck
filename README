= DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

This program is an interpretor for the Brainfuck language which was originally
designed by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language,
i.e. a joke. It was designed to challenege and amuse programmers. For a more 
complete description of the language see the Wikipedia article at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck


================================================================================
= COMPILING THE INTERPRETOR
================================================================================

 Linux & GCC

    gcc -o2 -o brainfuck brainfuck.c


================================================================================
= BASIC BRAINFUCK COMMANDS
================================================================================

  >    increment the data pointer (to the right)
  <    decrement the data pointer (to the left)
  +    increase (by one) the byte at the current pointer
  -    decrease (by one) the byte at the current pointer
  .    send the byte at the current pointer to stdout
  ,    accept one byte of input from the standard input
  [    if the byte at the pointer is zero, then jump to command after next ]
  ]    if the byte at the pointer is nonzero, then jump to matching [


================================================================================
= RUNNING A BRAINFUCK PROGRAM
